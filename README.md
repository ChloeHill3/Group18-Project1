## Description
As a web developer, I want to create a webpage for a Travel Agency that lets the user input destinations, dates, number of people and rooms, in order to organize their next trip. 
The user is also offered a list of events taking place in the same timeframe as the holiday for a more entertaining adventure.
The design and functionality of the website wants to give the user a clear and easy to follow path towards their next destination.
The technologies used are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
